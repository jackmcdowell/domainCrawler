# domainCrawler
A PHP program that searches for emails on a specific domain

This program outputs the URLs to an array ($array) and then searches through that array looking for emails, outputting them to a second array ($emailarray). And, it prints both arrays.

ToDo:
  Output to a more flexible format, perhaps a MySQL database
  Fix error handling with non-existent links
  Fix code to handle large websites
